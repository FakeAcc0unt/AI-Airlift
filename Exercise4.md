# Exercise 4 - Image Classification with Transfer Learning

In this exercise, you'll train a convolutional neural network using a technique called *transfer learning*.

You can chose between the following machine learning frameworks to train your model:

* **<a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>**
* **<a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">Keras</a>**

## Training an Image Classifier
1. In the **AI-Airlift/code** folder in your Jupyterhub instance, open the **04 - Transfer Learning (PyTorch).ipynb** or **04 - Transfer Learning (Keras).ipynb** notebook; depending on your preferred framework.
2. Read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell and reviewing the output. Take the time to examine the code and ensure you understand what it is doing.
