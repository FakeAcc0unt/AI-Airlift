In this exercise, you'll use Azure Machine Learning to deploy the image classificatoion model you created in the previous exercise.

## Using Azure ML to Deploy a Model
1. In the **AI-Airlift/code** folder in your Jupyterhub instance, open the **03 - Model Deployment (PyTorch).ipynb** or **03 - Model Deployment (Keras).ipynb**notebook; depending on the framework you used in the previous exercise.
2. Read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell and reviewing the output. Take the time to examine the code and ensure you understand what it is doing.
