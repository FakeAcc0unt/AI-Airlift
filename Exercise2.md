# Exercise 2 - Image Classification

In this exercise, you'll train a convolutional neural network to classify the images you created in the previous exercise.

You can chose between the following machine learning frameworks to train your model:

* **<a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>**
* **<a href="https://keras.io/" target="_blank">Keras</a>**

## Training an Image Classifier
1. In the **AI-Airlift/code** folder in your Jupyterhub instance, open the **02 - Image Classification (PyTorch).ipynb** or **02 - Image Classification (Keras).ipynb** notebook; depending on your preferred framework.
2. Read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell and reviewing the output. Take the time to examine the code and ensure you understand what it is doing.
